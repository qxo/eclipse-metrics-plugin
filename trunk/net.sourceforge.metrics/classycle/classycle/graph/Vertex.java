/**
 * The base class for any type of vertex in a directed graph.
 * <p>
 * A <tt>Vertex</tt> holds an {@link Attributes} object which encapsulates all properties of the vertex which is not necessary to know for parsing a graph in a {@link GraphProcessor}. Only the visited flag will be manipulated during
 * parsing.
 * <p>
 * A <tt>Vertex</tt> knows the head and tail vertices of all its outgoing and incoming arcs. When a head vertex is added by the method {@link #addOutgoingArcTo} also the corresponding incoming arc is built in the head vertex. The same is
 * true the other way around. Note, that multi-arcs are not possible. That is, adding an already added head/tail vertex again as a head/tail vertex will be ignored.
